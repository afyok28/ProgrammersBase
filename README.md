# ProgrammersBase
Spring Boot + JPA + PostgreSql + Thymeleaf

A programmer's best friend. A responsive web application / tool for saving and managing a database of helpful resources. Resources are saved into categories that are separated by programming languages. Resources consist of a title, a description, a textual body, an optional link to an outside resource, and an optional image (i.e. screenshot of a Java script), all of which can be edited or deleted at any time. All pages of the application (programming languages, categories, and resources) are sorted alphabetically and include pagination once records reach the specified threshold. The resources pages are searchable via a keyword search.
